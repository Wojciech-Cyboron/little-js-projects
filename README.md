# little-js-projects

Here are six projects I did in the course to practice JavaScript. <br> 
## And they are:
### Rollover image effect
A quick project to reposition an image and show the other image from underneath with a dynamic button
### Dynamic text
With the buttons we can change the font size and change the text color to random.
### Password Validator
Password validator. The password must meet three conditions:
- must have 10 characters 
- letters and numbers
- special characters
### Temperature converter
Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
### Nav Burger
Simple Burger Menu
### Random curiosity day
Api showing day of the week and random trivia
