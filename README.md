# little-js-projects

Here are six projects I did in the course to practice JavaScript. <br> 
## And they are:
### Rollover image effect
A quick project to reposition an image and show the other image from underneath with a dynamic button
### Dynamic text
With the buttons we can change the font size and change the text color to random.
### Password Validator
### Temperature converter
### Nav Burger
### Random curiosity day
